Three types of Bugs
1. Syntax error
    - bugs comes from typos
2. Runtime Errors
    - while the program is running
    - works up until it reaches the code with the error
    - will terminate with an error message
    - python will display traceback
        - an error message showing the line containing the problem
3. Semantic Errors
    - trickiest to fix
    - prevent the program from doing what the programmer inteded it to do.
