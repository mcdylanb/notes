## Expression
- basic kind of programming instruction in the language
- are just values combined with operators
- always evaluate down to a single value  

 ***consist of:***
- Values
- Operators
- Evaluate

## Math Operators from Highest to Lowest Precedence

 Operator | Operation |	Example | Evaluates to
--- | --- | --- | ---
**	|	Exponent	|	2**3	|	8
%	|	Modules/remainder	|22 % 8		|6
//	|	integer division	|22 // 8		|2
/	|	Division		|22 / 8		|2.75
*	|	Multiplication		|3 * 5		|15
- 	|	Subtraction		|5 - 2		|3
+	|	Addition		|2 + 2		|4

## Data Type  
- category for values
- every value belongs to one data type

Common Data Types

Data Type |		Examples
 --- | ---
Integers	|	-2, -1, 0, 1, 2
FLoating-point numbers	| -1.25, -1.0, -0.5
Strings 	|	'a', 'aa'

- Operators work base on kind of data types
	- String Concatenation
		ex: 	'Alice' + 'Wonderland'
			AliceWonderland
	- String Replication	
		ex:	'Alice' * 5
			ALiceAliceAliceAliceAlice
Variables
	- box in the computer memory where you can store single value
	- Assignment Statements
		- Consist of: Variable Name, an eual sign(assingment operator)
	- Initialized
	- Overwriting

	- **Three Rules Naming Variables**
		- It can be only one word with no spaces
		- it can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore
		- It cant begin with a number
